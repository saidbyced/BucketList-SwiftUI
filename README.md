This is an iOS app that lets the user build a private list of places on the map that they intend to visit one day, add a description for that place and look up interesting places that are nearby, savin it all to iOS storage for later.

## Credit
This app was built using the ‘Bucket List’ section of the e-book 'Hacking with iOS: SwiftUI Edition' and Apple's SwiftUI Tutorial (specifically [this section](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views#Use-UIKit-and-SwiftUI-Views-Together)). Personal improvements were added where I found possibilities to reduce duplication or complexity.
